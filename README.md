## DDoS Script By VatieraSynth

This is a simple yet effective Python script created for penetration testing on SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) servers. It allows testers to simulate traffic overloads by targeting core aspects of the SAMP server protocol, such as connection handling and query responses.

The script is intended to help server owners and developers identify vulnerabilities and improve their server's resistance to basic DDoS-style attacks. It's lightweight, easy to modify, and meant to be used strictly in authorized environments for security testing purposes.
